# Lab2-Ansible
This repo is used to configure 2 Palo alto firewalls that are HA pairs (High-availablity). Both firewalls will then connect to a core router. 
The repo will contain ansible facts that will grab facts about the topology to create a audit report very quickly.
This repo will contain the diagram of the network, playbooks, descriptions of the playbooks and how the network is deployed.
